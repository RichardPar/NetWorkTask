# NetWorkTask
Shows an icon on windows 10 whether a Internet link is there or not

The Application is written using Lazarus Pascal and just shows an ICON on the status of a PING reply.
I wrote this app as I travel alot and use mobile data - I would like to see a better view of whether the 
network is really online or offline
